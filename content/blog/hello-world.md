# Hello, world!
Thanks for checking out my personal blog!

I'm planning to use this as a space to collect and keep my thoughts as I journey through life.

Right now, I'm an Engineering Manager at a pretty well known tech company. I've been in tech since before I graduated UCSD in 2017 and a manager since February of 2021.

Outside of work, I consume and create music, play all kinds of games, and enjoy nature.

Thanks for stopping by. Contact me on twitter [@IAmSeanGref](https://twitter.com/IAmSeanGref) if you have any thoughts about what I should write about.

Cheers!
