As you improve your skills, a natural development is to increase your scope of influence. Unfortunately, we usually can't maintain all the responsibilities you have today *and* take on more scope. The best way to resolve this is with delegation.

Note: This applies to both a developer taking on more of a leadership role (tech lead, project lead, etc.) and a manager growing more influence.

Delegation is one of several tools at your disposal, but in the [matrix of prioritization](https://www.fool.com/the-blueprint/prioritization-matrix/), it's the only solution that gets the work done without you having to do it.

## When to Delegate

It isn't always easy knowing in the moment when you should take on a task personally or when you should delegate, but doing regular self-reflection can help. Journaling at the beginning and end of each work day have helped me stay focused and prioritize tasks. It's also let me discover when my work-load is becoming too much for me to handle alone. I've even identified times when another person was better for a task that I was trying take on.

You may also consider just assessing this each time you're about to take on an additional task. I find this to be more cumbersome because I have to go over my task-list with each new task. While I regularly add multiple tasks to to-do list in a day, I rarely get a task that I have to do so urgently that it can't wait until my next morning jounraling/prioritizing session.

As your ownership grows, it's tempting to try to handle it all. However, I fundamentally disagree with the phrase "if you want something done right, do it yourself" and [I'm not the only one](https://www.inc.com/david-finkel/if-you-want-something-done-right-do-it-yourself-and-other-lies-that-keep-you-from-being-successful.html). One way to find a good balance is delegating until you have *less than* full capacity in your own workload. When you try to tackle everything, you are more likely to burn out, quickly reducing your contributions to a minimal crawl. You may also not be able to deliver everything you're expecting. Finally, as you overwork yourself by not delegating, the quality of your work can suffer if you have too many tasks pulling your attention.

## How to Delegate For Personal Growth

There's [plenty](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_98.htm) of [other sources](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-10-rules-of-successful-delegation) to [learn](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/how-to-delegate-effectively) how to delegate, so I won't go into much detail here. Instead, I'll focus on how to use it for persoanl growth.

**Two big caveats**: don't focus on growth, focus on doing your job well and growth will follow; and you should never over-delegate or try to simply absolve yourself of responsibility.

Delegation of a task does not mean you are free from responsibility. In order to truly free up your time from this task and not create additional overhead, set up a system to ensure success. As stated in the first article linked in this section (the word "plenty"):

> Start by specifying the outcome you desire to the people you trust to deliver it. Establish controls, identify limits to the work and provide sufficient support, but resist upward delegation. Keep up to date with progress, and focus on results rather than procedures. Finally, when the work is completed, give recognition where itâ€™s deserved.

When you are successfully delegating, you can focus on your top priorities, or even start [innovating](https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/what-to-do-with-free-time-at-work-1017). These are the times you will be doing your best work since you'll have more dedicated focus-time. If you delegate effectively, your whole team will be operating well. This is the key to success, since [perfect practice makes perfect](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/29093-practice-does-not-make-perfect-perfect-practice-makes-perfect).

## Nobody To Delegate To?

Sometimes there may be nobody else you can delegate to. This can occur when there isn't enough staffing to do a task in the expected timeline. This is a tough situation and I feel for you. Hold on, do your best, and try not to burn out.
